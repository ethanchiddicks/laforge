= Sound on/off switch
- Range selection switch
= Hardware reset switch

- More environment distance range data
- Sensorless testing of distance perception capabilities (via control program)

= Smoother directional sound generation (15 degrees is too jerky)
	- More HRIRs
	or:
	- HRIR interpolation via two simultaneous filters and proportional attenuation

- Gyro centre reset algorithm
- Separate distance ranges
- Try adding parallax
