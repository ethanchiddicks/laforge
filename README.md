This was part of a design project from January to April 2008. The goal of the project was to design and build a device which would help users navigate on foot without the benefit of sight.

This was accomplished through a "wand" component consisting of a distance sensor and an accelerometer, and an audio component which would create a virtual sound source at a position corresponding to detected surfaces.

This worked in a rough sense. Challenges were the accuracy of the distance and wand position sensing, as well as the clarity of the virtual sound source.
